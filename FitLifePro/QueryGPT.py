I will give you a client's: 
Age - Please accommodate older and younger clients.
Current weight-  (in pounds)
Current height- (in inches)
Fitness level(on a scale of 1-10, 1 being worst, 10 being best) - if they are heavy relative to their height and out of shape make sure that you keep this in mind). If they are in very good shape, feel free to add more/more difficult exercises that still would fit in the given time frame.
Personal goals - what they want to accomplish by going to the gym consistently.
Current injuries - you must make sure you accommodate injuries when making the plan.
Time - amount of time to complete their workout in minutes.
Focus â€“ what muscle groups they plan to target for their current workout.
